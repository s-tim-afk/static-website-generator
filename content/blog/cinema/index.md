I'm not a movie critic by any means, but sometimes I watch a movie and I feel like I have to tell the world about it. You can follow me on [letterboxd](https://boxd.it/6spz7) if you want, but I don't really leave reviews on there, just log films.

## Mind Game (2004) - Masaaki Yuasa

>  ![Mind Game](../../images/mind-game.jpg) For the longest time, I wouldn't have had an answer to the question "What is your favourite movie of all time?" but now I do. This is the greatest film ever made. I haven't stopped thinking about it since I first saw it some three years ago, and I've re-watched it a good few times since. It's entirely unique and heartfelt. This is a movie about living, making the most of the one life you have, and it gets me so hyped any time I watch it. It's full of powerful moments (especially in the final act) that cut right through any barrier to sincere emotion that you might have up.<br><br>The only caveat is that this movie is from Japan and, not to be racist or anything, but ASIAN PEOPLE ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚. (i hopefully don't need to clarify that that was a reference to an old vine, and not an actual race-related gripe I have with this film). The actual complaint that I _hate_ to have is that, being a Japanese animation, you've got some... fan-servicey moments when it comes to the female lead. It's pretty much contained to the beginning of the movie, and it's not exactly fan-service for the sake of fan-service - it's borne of our main character being a loser. I just recognise that it might put some people off if they put this film on without seeing much else about it, and that would be a shame, because it is truly one of the greatest movies of all time.<br><br>Aside from the beautiful message behind it, it's a movie that really does something interesting with the medium of animation that I don't really have the vocabulary nor intelligence to explain with any degree of justice. It annoys me when people try and argue that "animation isn't just for kids!" and then use movies that are **definitively made for kids** as examples of "grown-up animation", instead of pointing people towards something like this. If you decide to act on only one recommendation from me, make it this.

## True Stories (1986) - David Byrne

> ![True Stories](../../images/true-stories.jpg) This one is a nice slow-paced, understated, slice-of-life comedy (think _Napoleon Dynamite_) that had me smiling and got a good lot of laughs out of me. You've got a young John Goodman in this, if that's the kind of thing that gets you going. If you're a fan of Talking Heads (which you should be) then you know what to expect with a David Byrne project, and you'll definitely enjoy it. It goes without saying that the soundtrack is fantastic. It's a shame he didn't direct more films.

## Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters (1985) - Paul Schrader

> ![Mishima](../../images/mishima.jpg) Taxi Driver isn't the type of movie I feel needs to be on this list. Yeah it's fantastic, but everyone _knows_ about Taxi Driver, everybody knows it's widely regarded as being among the greatest films. This film, however, should be more widely known. If you're wondering why I even mentioned Taxi Driver, it's because this was written and directed by Paul Schrader, who wrote the screenplay for Taxi Driver.<br>This is an exploration of a pretty evil man, a literal fascist, so I don't want to say I understand him or have sympathy for him, but I will say the movie does a great job displaying him as a human being, a character to be understood - owing of course to Mishima's own writings being so open about what was going on in his mind and his own self-image.<br><br>That's not the main appeal of this movie for me, though. This is hands down the most beautiful, visually appealing film I've seen in a long time. I haven't watched it in a long time, so I don't feel comfortable talking about most aspects of it, but the imagery has stuck with me still. This is another case of "they don't make 'em like they used to"; films just aren't _allowed_ to look this pretty anymore.

## Brazil (1985) - Terry Gilliam

> ![Brazil](../../images/brazil.jpg) I wasn't aware of Terry Gilliam's game outside of Monty Python and this is definitely a must watch if you are in the same position. It's a beautifully designed world with amazing practical sets/miniatures - the kind that they don't let people make anymore. The dream sequences are genuinely enthralling; I caught myself sitting up and leaning closer into the screen like a child watching Cocomelon whenever our hero would slip into one of his fantasies (like I really don't want to give away anything, but the samurai warrior sequences in this are what movies are all about).<br><br>Unfortunately however, the film struggles in terms of pacing. It doesn't hit its story beats, its highs and lows, in a satisfying way. Maybe that's the point, but I somehow doubt that, since Gilliam doesn't seem the sort.<br>As much as I enjoyed the movie, it doesn't really have anything interesting to say. It gets compared to "1984", or described as "if 1984 was a comedy" and that's a pretty apt description because, like Orwell, Gilliam doesn't seem to have a coherent ideology. The movie is a critique of society in the most vague and broadly appealing way, and that's fine, it's just a shame that there were little nuggets of something interesting strewn throughout the movie that all went nowhere (like the hero's guilty conscience). Gilliam creates this amazingly detailed (on a surface level, at least) world that you understand straight away because of the meticulous sets, but then tells a pretty boring story in it.<br><br>It's still absolutely worth a watch - you've got greats like Michael Palin, Bob Hoskins, Robert DeNiro (wtf) in this visually stimulating world, with a nice soundtrack to boot (they make frequent and welcome use of the old samba classic "Brasil").

## The Man Who Stole the Sun (1979) - Kazuhiko Hasegawa

> ![The Man Who Stole the Sun](../../images/stole-the-sun.jpg) I don't know how to describe this one. By all accounts it's a b-movie - like, I want to say my love for it is overblown and if I look at it objectively, I'll see it's just a so-so film. But that's not the case; I still think it's special. It's kind of slow and apathetic, like the main character, and you feel you really get to know him throughout. At the same time, it has some fun sequences that you would think means the tone is all over the place, but it works.<br><br>It's got a great soundtrack (the track "Yamashita" being the reason I even discovered this movie in the first place) which even features a Takanaka track used perfectly - the only time I've heard a song of his in a film (lmk if you know of any other examples). This one really reminds me of summer for some reason (maybe it's the Takanaka song!) and I think it's definitely one you can stick on and get the same cosy kind of feeling.

## Night on Earth (1991) - Jim Jarmusch, various

> ![Night on Earth](../../images/night-on-earth.jpg) This is one that just came up on our dodgy box one day ðŸ˜„ and I decided to check it out. I'm really glad I did. It's another slice-of-life, kind of quiet comedy. An anthology this time - you get five movies for the price of one!<br><br>I think the first one is probably the weakest, and even then it's not like it's bad, so definitely give it a chance past that, because the second short is great. You have Giancarlo Esposito in a comic role (which I wish they would let him do more often nowadays, instead of relegating him to playing Gus Fring clones) and it's just a wholesome glimpse into these strangers' eventful-uneventful night. The following shorts are just as good. The fourth one with the Italian cab driver is just good old-fashioned _Carry On!_-esque hijinks and was the most consistently funny (I think I laughed through that entire one).<br><br>P.S. speaking of Giancarlo Esposito playing comic relief, if you haven't seen Spike Lee's _Do the Right Thing_, absolutely check that out too. It's one of my favourite movies of all time, but I don't think it needs its own entry on this list, for the same reasons as Taxi Driver.
