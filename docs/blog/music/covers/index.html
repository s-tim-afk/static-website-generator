    <article><div><h1>Covers</h1><h3><a href="../">< Music</a></h3><p><a href="/static-website-generator/.."><< Back Home</a></p><p>I've been messing around with 'music production' but calling it that makes it sound way more impressive than what I'm actually doing. I have some original music but I don't think any of that is ready for public consumption, so I'll be posting covers I've done here for now...</p><h2>Oh! Tengo Suerte - Masayoshi Takanaka</h2><p><iframe style="border:none" height="427" width="760" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sVL8ThvirZY"></iframe></p><blockquote><br><br>I was never really musically inclined for most of my life, but when I first was exposed to Takanaka through sheer luck maybe half a decade ago, I felt for the first time that I wanted to try do what he was doing, so I got myself a guitar. Fitting then that the first cover I post here is a cover of the first song of his I ever heard. I don't want to put too much weight on that moment but it was a very eye-opening one and his music still means a lot to me.<br><br>This cover isn't what one might call "good" but I'm actually kind of happy with how it turned out. Still, if you haven't heard of Takanaka before, go listen to the original. Don't let my interpretation of this masterpiece be the reason you avoid the work of an amazing musician. If you do decide to listen to him, try seek out the compilation album <i>'All of Me'</i> and savour the time you spend listening to it. That was the album that introduced me to Takanaka and I wish I could experience listening to it for the first time all over again.<br><br></blockquote></div></article>
