    <article><div><h1>Music</h1><p><a href="/static-website-generator/">< Back Home</a></p><h2>The Boredoms</h2><blockquote><img src="../../images/boredoms-collage" alt="Boredoms"></img> This is a "genre" (whatever that means) of music at which, even a couple years ago, I would've turned my nose up. But I've grown up and have learned to appreciate most things in life, and being in an altered state (for any potential employers reading, by that I mean getting high on life) and listening to "noise-core" like this is ironically one of the most serene experiences I've had. It started by being recommended The Gerogerigegege's live album '<i>Tokyo Anal Dynamite</i>' to which I thought "haha funny name, I'll give that a listen" but pretty soon I had listened to the full 30 minute set of incoherent screaming and screeching guitars and found myself wanting more. In all fairness to the algorithm, it provided; showing me The Boredoms' '<i>Anal by Anal</i>' LP (I'm not going to critically reflect on why albums with those names were recommended to me) and again; play that for me a few months ago and I'd think you were taking the piss, but I really enjoyed it. I've since listened to *a lot* of the Boredoms' stuff, and only a bit more of The Gerogerigegege's ouvre, but I can't believe how much I've grown to love the music they make. <br><br> At the risk of putting anyone off of the Boredoms' earlier work, I think I have to say it's easier to get into their later stuff, like '<i>Vision Creation Newsun</i>' or one of the later entries in the '<i>Super Roots</i>' series. These albums are still noisy and sometimes sound like a boomer's exaggerated idea of what them crazy kids are listening to (<a href="https://youtu.be/EKuAsndvxvs?si=GAF75ii2jr504Ue1">"When do they stop tuning their instruments and start playing the music?"</a>) but they're not so out there that you might turn them off if you haven't heard anything like it before. '<i>Super æ</i>' falls into this category too, it being one of my favourites ('<i>Super Shine</i>' is a fantastic track off this album). Everything from this later era has a great mantric, joyous exaltation feeling to it (exemplified in the '<i>Super Roots</i>' LPs). <br><br> Their earlier stuff isn't to be ignored either, with LPs like '<i>Chocolate Synthesizer</i>', '<i>Soul Discharge</i>' and the aforementioned '<i>Anal by Anal</i>' being fun little excursions into a world of music you may not make a habit of listening to. <br><br> What I'll try to do for any artist I mention here is give one single album or even a single track that I think you should try and listen to to see if it leaves you wanting more. In this case, I would say try '<i>Super æ</i>' and if you don't have time for the whole album, you can take 15 minutes to listen to the track '<i>Super Shine</i>'. All going well, you can follow up on some of the other albums mentioned here, or let the algorithm take you where it sees fit.</blockquote></div></article>
