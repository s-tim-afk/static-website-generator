I guess they used to call them blogs, and I never would have imagined I would have one. I used to think <i>"Who the f*ck am I to have a blog? Who wants to read about me?"</i>. I mean, I still think that, and I hope the answer to that question is still "no-one" because there are way more rewarding things you can do with your time than read boring details about a complete stranger...</p><p><b>YET</b>... here this website is. Despite everything, it still remains. That's because this is more for myself I suppose. I have a really deep faux-nostalgia for the early internet. When you would actually <i>surf the web</i>, going from webpage to webpage and feeling this sense of discovery. When the internet was a <b>place</b> that you went to - you had to sit down at the 'puter and log on and it was this whole thing, and once you got up out of your chair that was it until you logged back on. It didn't follow you everywhere you went, deploying every little psychological tactic (developed by Nazi scientists and tested on innocent men, women and children held in CIA blacksites) to try and keep your attention - to try and keep you <i>engaged</i>.</p><p>I say <i>faux</i>-nostalgia because I can't really claim to have grown up on the early internet. Being born in 2002, even <i>Bebo</i> was nearly extinct by the time I was starting to regularly use the internet... fuckin' <i>Bebo</i>, man.</p><p>But for the first few years of my internet life, it was magical. It wasn't like today where your entire presence is confined to a handful of sites (like X, the Everything app! Blaze your glory!). I used to get my alloted time on the family laptop and I would just like... type things into the search bar and look at stuff. I never had a plan or anything but you can bet your bottom dollar that Jeeves was getting asked a couple of three things.</p><p>It seemed as insane to me back then as it does now, that the entire wealth of humanity's knowledge was available for us here. Well, not so much anymore I guess, with the rich and powerful doing their damnedest to destroy any democratising power that this great resource, this great product of human cooperation and ingenuity might have ever had, by attacking places like the Internet Archive or Wikipedia with lawsuits and propoganda campaigns. Throw all the AI slop filling any and every search engine into the bargain making it more and more dificult to find... <i>anything</i> and you start to think maybe... maybe Ted Kaczynski h-</p><p><b>Issuing correction on my previous statement regarding U.S. domestic terrorist 'the Unabomber'. You do not, under any circumstances, "gotta hand it to him"</b>.</p><blockquote>Isn't it such a coincidence that everything from when I was young was great and perfect and everything now is scary and wrong?   I'm probably the only person to ever feel this way.</blockquote><p>I hate to have such a hopeless demeanour on the landing page of my little space, but there's a real apathy in society now that I think has really been exacerbated by the modern internet (it used to be a place filled with nobodies doing silly things that made them happy, but now everybody <i>posts</i> with the hope of going viral and turning this tool for human connection and creativity into a source of wealth (huh, it always comes back to capital. That Marx guy might have been on to something...)). I'm not gonna fix that, so the best I can do is make something pointless; something personal and unpolished, something decidedly unviral and unprofitable.</p><p>So, back to this cool little website!</p><p>Creating this static website generator was also a fun little project/challenge for myself to improve my Python skills as well as getting faster at touch-typing (it's actually hard - why can my mother type faster than me??).</p><p>Plus having this public record of what I'm doing (even though nobody will be reading it) is hopefully going to make me lock in in any endeavours. I hope to do a few things with this space, including (but not limited to!);</p><h3><a href="/static-website-generator/blog/coding_projects">Coding Projects</a></h3><p>Not sure what these will entail, truly, but hopefully some amazing, world-changing stuff. Or just like, updating this website generator - already as I'm typing this, I want to do things with this page that my code can't actually do which makes me feel violent urges towards whatever idiot wrote it...</p><h3><a href="/static-website-generator/blog/book_club">Book Club</a></h3><p>Probably just gonna post little updates on books I'm reading/have read. Little reviews/recommendations you know? Nothin' fancy.</p><h3><a href="/static-website-generator/blog/music">Music</a></h3><p>I've been messing around with music production. Posting any original projects of mine would constitute cruel and unusual punishment for now, so if I post anything here, it'll be some of the covers I've done. Also maybe recommendations here too, artists I like or am currently listening to. You get the idea.</p><p>I might even host album rips on here if I make the site more robust. It's important to archive art and share it with the world imho...</p><h3><a href="/static-website-generator/blog/gaeilge">Ár dTeanga</a></h3><p>Chinn mé ar iarracht a dhéanamh an Ghaeilge a labhairt níos minice. Níl fhios agam go fóill cén chuma a bheidh ar an iarracht sin, ach b'fhéidir go mbeidh mé in ann na leathanach seo a aistriú. Neosfaidh an aimsir.</p><p>Want to get in touch? <a href="/static-website-generator/contact">Contact me here</a>.</p></div></article>
